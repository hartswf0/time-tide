# Adobe Killer Slit-Scan Camera System

A professional-grade slit-scan camera system with advanced sediment processing, organic blending, and creative layering tools that Adobe would never make.

## Features

- **Advanced Sediment Processing**: Analyze motion and create realistic sediment layers
- **Organic Blending Modes**: Multiple ways to blend layers for natural, organic results
- **Creative Layering Tools**: Fine-grained control over how layers interact
- **Full-Screen View**: Immersive experience for your sediment visualizations
- **Color Shifting**: Dynamic color transformations between layers
- **Wave Pattern Generation**: Create complex wave patterns based on motion data
- **Erosion Effects**: Simulate natural erosion processes in your visualizations
- **Export Options**: Save your work in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PNG)

## Controls Explained

### Basic Controls
- **Slit Width**: Controls the width of the sampling slit from the camera feed
- **Scan Speed**: Determines how quickly the system samples new slits
- **Highlight Current**: Highlights the most recently added sediment layer

### Sediment Controls
- **Tidal Factor**: Influences the wave-like movement of sediment layers
- **Wave Energy**: Controls the intensity of wave patterns in the visualization
- **Erosion Threshold**: Determines how easily layers erode based on motion
- **Compaction Rate**: Controls how quickly layers compress over time (can be set to 0)

### Layering Controls
- **Layering Mode**: Different ways to stack and arrange sediment layers
- **Blend Mode**: How layers blend with each other visually
- **Color Shift**: Controls color transformations between layers
- **Opacity Control**: Fine-tune the transparency of individual layers

### View Options
- **Wave Pattern Toggle**: Show/hide the wave pattern background
- **Full Screen View**: Expand the visualization to fill the entire screen
- **Heatmap View**: Alternative visualization based on motion intensity
